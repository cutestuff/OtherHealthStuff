Collecting Infor about things that worked for me over the years

# Mouth health
For about 1-2 years I feel an almost constant burning in my mouth, tip of the tongue. No dentist bothered to give a diagnosis, so here is what worked for me so far. 
 * Dip of chilly powder - works for about an hour before it gets bad again
 * Brushing with Neem plant stick - phenomenal
   * Thoughts: So I think it's a bacterial or fungal issue - Thought about candida, but even if it is, meds would only solve this temprarily. According to a few papers, candida can't be "destroyed", only culled back and then it returns with some more resistance to the thing you used.

# Back Pain
 * movement despite the hurt makes it better, some yoga poses help but I eventually ended up with:
 * Hollow hold - works the best for me
 * Thougths: I work sitting all day long, the way I sit I'm stretching my back and glutes, but not the frontal muscles and hamstrings.
 * There is this youtube channel StayFlexy - when I see his vids, I try to do what he does

# Depression
 * Thoughts: I do remember fighting with my mum over food, and I do suffer from ptsd (beatings and bullying)- so it might be psychological, but I also think, everyone ruined their guts in the 90ies with fast food and snickers
 * Ketogenic diet and carnivore diet with few organs, rumen is my favorite. - Within a week of not eating crap, most of the depression lifted, see one of the other repositories.

# Post Covid
 * Acetylcysteine
 * Tudca
